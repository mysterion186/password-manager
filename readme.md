You'll need to install the clipboard module  
There is commented line to create the csv file with the following information(domain name,login,password)[for management.py]  
[test for gitignore]
Your password will be stored there with a base64 encode (basic one)   
futur improvement :  
    *create a encode/decode function using a key (main password of the user )
